 What about branches?

 We don't want to conflict with OpenSSL branch names. Our current plan is to append

 What about library names?
 -------------------------

 Library names will be the same, but will use a different version number. The version
 numbers for the current OpenSSL libraries are `1.1` (for the 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 branches)
 and `3` (for the to-be-3.0 branch). We will be prefixing 81 (ASCII for 'Q') to
 the version numbers to generate a unique version number.
